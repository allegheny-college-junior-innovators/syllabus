## Learning Outcomes

### Official Course Description

> An introduction to the technical and communication skills needed to design, implement, and publicly release innovative software. In addition to establishing connections with professionals in the software field, students refine their writing abilities as they participate in online technical communities. During a weekly practical session, students use state-of-the-art tools to complete well-documented software that is useful to external collaborators, describing their systems through oral presentations and written documents featured on a web site. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Tell a compelling professional narrative
- Compile a focused list of viable opportunities that closely align with your background, interests, and goals
- Maintain and tailor a resume or curriculum vitae that is a complete inventory of your professional experiences and accomplishments
- Have an online presence in the form of a portfolio website that showcases your professional identity and work
- Identify and follow through on networking opportunities

## Grading

### Breakdown

| Category          | Percentage |
|-------------------|------------|
| Attendance        | 10%        |
| Assignments       | 60%        |
| Portfolio Website | 30%        |
| **Total**         | **100%**   |

#### Attendance

It is important for you to attend every class. Not only does being present give you the opportunity to check your understanding, ask questions, and get feedback on your assignments, but it gives you valuable time to get to know your peers, who may someday become part of your professional network or even lifelong friends! I will note your attendance each class and at the end of the semester your attendance will be converted from a fraction (**# of classes attended / total # of classes**) to a percentage (all percentages will be rounded up to the nearest whole percentage). This attendance grade will make up 10% of your overall grade.

If you ever find yourself sick or in need of a mental health day, please stay home and rest. **You can still receive your attendance for the class or lab session you missed as long as you communicate with me your reason for missing the class or lab session by the end of that day**. If there are extenuating circumstances that make you unable to communicate with me through Discord or email by the end of the day of your absence, make sure to follow up with me at your earliest ability. If you do not communicate the reason for your absence before or during the next time I see you, I will assume that your absence was avoidable and you will not receive attendance for that class.

#### Assignments

Throughout the semester, you will receive assignments that will challenge you to solidify your professional identity and make progress towards pursuing professional opportunities. Some assignments will be stepping stones to creating your portfolio website. All assignments are designed to help strengthen the way you interact with and present yourself to others in the computer science world.

Because assignment submissions will greatly vary from student to student, due to diverse interests and goals, assignments will be mainly graded based on completion of their requirements.

#### Portfolio Website

Bringing together components produced in previous assignments, you will develop a portfolio website that showcases your professional identity and work. Your portfolio website should communicate to visitors who you are, where you have been (i.e. past experiences and accomplishments), and where you are headed (i.e. interests and goals). More specific requirements for this portfolio website will be announced later in the semester.

### Due Dates and Extensions

Unless otherwise announced by me, all assignments and the portfolio website will be due on the date and at the time stated in their instructions.

Extensions may be granted on a case-by-case basis at my discretion if there are extenuating circumstances that significantly affect your ability to complete the work on time. You must communicate with me before the due date, preferably at least one week in advance, that you would like to request an extension. **If you do not communicate with me about an extension before the due date, I reserve the right to grade only the work submitted by the due date, even if you submit additional work after the due date.**

### Scale

| Letter Grade | Percentage   |
|--------------|--------------|
| A            | 96 - 100     |
| A-           | 90 - 95      |
| B+           | 87 - 89      |
| B            | 83 - 86      |
| B-           | 80 - 82      |
| C+           | 77-79        |
| C            | 73 - 76      |
| C-           | 70 - 72      |
| D+           | 67 - 69      |
| D            | 63 - 66      |
| D-           | 60 - 62      |
| F            | 59 and below |

Fractional grades will be rounded to the nearest whole percentage, according to normal rounding rules. For example, 89.49 will become 89 and 89.5 will become 90.

## Institutional And Departmental Policies

### Statement of Community

Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

### Honor Code


The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and the final project). All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:

> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.

It is understood that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly one in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone elseâ€™s work. While it is acceptable for students in this class to discuss their programs, data sets, and reports with their classmates, deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.


### Disability Services

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at (814) 332-2898.  ODS is located in Pelletier Library.  Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
